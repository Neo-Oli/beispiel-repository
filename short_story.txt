The Digital Solutions Team gathered in a small conference room, their laptops glowing with a mix of excitement and fear.

"Alright, team," Oli, their lead, began. "Today, we conquer Git and GitHub."

A few nervous chuckles echoed as they opened their terminals.

"Git is like a time machine for your code," Oli explained. "GitHub is where we store those timelines. First, we clone a repo, then add changes, commit, and finally, push."

Everyone followed along, amazed as their code versions were neatly tracked and stored.

By the end, the team grinned. "We might just have mastered it," Dani said. Oli winked, "Next, pull requests!"
